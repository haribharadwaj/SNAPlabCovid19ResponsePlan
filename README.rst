SNAPlab COVID-19 Response Plan
##############################

This document outlines
an evolving plan for research activities
at the Systems Neuroscience of Auditory Perception Lab (SNAPlab)
in response to the COVID-19 situation.

Basics
======

* We will adhere to all policies and guidance provided by `Purdue <https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q1/need-to-know-info-about-covid-2019.html>`_,
  the `CDC <http://coronavirus.gov>`_, and other federal and `local government authorities <https://www.in.gov/coronavirus/>`_.
* Because we can afford to for now, we will also take additional precautions in the spirit of social distancing
  and self-isolation (under some conditions) that sometimes go beyond the guidance issued by the authorities.
* Work from home. Come into LYLE only if absolutely necessary. All classes for the semester have now moved online.
* In-person human subjects research is fully on hold per the directive of `Purdue IRB <https://www.irb.purdue.edu>`_,
  so no human subject visits for now, *including pilot testing on friends/colleagues*.
