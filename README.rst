##############################

This document outlines
an evolving plan for research activities
at the Systems Neuroscience of Auditory Perception Lab (SNAPlab)
in response to the COVID-19 situation.

Basics
======

* We will adhere to all policies and guidance provided by Purdue, the CDC, and other federal and local government authorities.
  We will also take additional precautions in the spirit of social distancing
  and self-isolation (under some conditions) that go beyond the guidance issued by the authorities.
* By default, work from home. Come into LYLE only if absolutely necessary
* In-person human subjects research is hold per the directive of Purdue IRB, so no human subject visits for now, *including pilot testing on friends/colleagues.*
