SNAPlab COVID-19 Response Plan
##############################

This document outlines
an evolving plan for research activities
at the Systems Neuroscience of Auditory Perception Lab (SNAPlab)
in response to the COVID-19 situation.
Needless to say, the health and safety of our members, colleagues,
and participants is the foremost priority. With that in mind,
there are also research activities that we can move forward on
in these uncertain times. If you have concerns about this plan,
please let Hari know by e-mail. Stay healthy!

Basics
======

* We will adhere to all policies and guidance provided by `Purdue <https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q1/need-to-know-info-about-covid-2019.html>`_,
  the `CDC <http://coronavirus.gov>`_, and other federal and `local government authorities <https://www.in.gov/coronavirus/>`_.
* Because we can afford to for now, we will also take additional precautions in the spirit of social distancing
  and self-isolation (under some conditions) that sometimes go beyond the guidance issued by the authorities.
* We will work from home and come into LYLE only if absolutely necessary (which it probably isn't). All classes for the semester have now moved online.
* In-person human subjects research is fully on hold per the directive of `Purdue IRB <https://www.irb.purdue.edu>`_,
  so no human subject visits for now, *including pilot testing on friends/colleagues*. If you are in the midst of an e-mail back and forth with subjects,
  advise them that we will contact them at a more opportune time for any in-person studies and that we are exploring options for online studies.
* If you are a student and back home for spring break, please consider whether you would like to stay at home or come back to campus.
  Currently, there is not much we can accomplish specifically by being on campus that we cannot accomplish from home.
  In case you do decide to come back to campus, please see the self isolation section associated with travel.
* Check communication channels like e-mail and blackboard regularly.


Working from home
=================
* All data that we have collected are remotely accessible through our synology drive ("Z drive", which contains larger-sized data),
  google drive (organizational files and protocols),
  or our OSF pages (some protocols files).
* For those of us involved in coding up experiments or elaborate analyses, the general base code for our lab is available via our github pages.
* As you know, access has been provided to all those who need access to specific areas of our different cloud repositories.
  In case you are missing access to any key areas that you believe you need, please let Hari know to fix it.
* We think we all are fortunate enough to have access to a computer and good-quality internet to be able to work from home, and access course material.
  If this is a concern (e.g., data limits imposed by your ISP), please e-mail Hari to discuss options.
* For heavier computing, remote access into your desktop computer in LYLE (rather than a home computer or laptop) is perhaps the best option.
  Please let Hari know if you are having any trouble accessing your computer remotely and you have plans to do extensive computing/analyses.
* In terms of *what* we could be doing from home to keep research activities going,
  the best course of action varies from person to person and could range from writing papers/grants, reading literature,
  performing data analysis, exploring online options for psychoacoustics, learning software skills (e.g., MATLAB/Python and our usual toolboxes), etc.
  **Please e-mail Hari to setup a time during the week after spring break to discuss and come up with a plan**
* All meetings will happen via online tools (WebEx, Zoom, Skype) by default.


Social distancing and hygiene
=============================
* We will adhere to the recommendations by authorities about avoiding larger groups, staying at home except for essential errands, and avoiding public transport.
* We will adhere to recommended practices to protect ourselves by implementing preventative steps (e.g., washing hands regularly) against contracting and spreading covid-19 and other diseases.
* For definitive information, please see the `CDC page on prevention <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html>`_.

Self Isolation
==============
* We will practice self-isolation if:

   1. We think there is a possibility that we may be sick (or)
   2. We think we may have been exposed to COVID-19 through contact with someone who tested positive or is under care for suspected covid-19 exposure (or)
   3. We come back to campus after undertaking air travel of any kind (or)
   4. We come back to campus from out of state, regardless of means of travel.
* For what it means to self-isolate when we think we may be sick or if we may be exposed to covid-19, please refer to `the corresponding CDC page <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html>`_.
  **If you are in Indiana**, please see the `IU health coronavirus page <https://iuhealth.org/find-medical-services/coronavirus>`_
  for information including obtaining a free screening (which starts with a "virtual" visit).
* For self-isolating due to travel (either by air anywhere, or by any means returning from out of state),
  we will follow the same steps recommended by the CDC for those returning from international travel (i.e., self isolation as if we think we may have been exposed for a 14-day period PLUS `the proper steps to discontinue self isolation as described by the CDC <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html>`_).

It is unlikely that we will *need* to come into work, but in case we do
=======================================================================
* Please wipe down hard surfaces with Clorox wipes (available in the lab) when you first come in and when you are about to leave.
* For hard to wipe surfaces such as keyboard, spray hydrogen peroxide (that we normally use for disinfecting the EEG caps) from a distance and let air dry (before and after again).
* Use Purell (available in the lab) before and after each time you are make contact with another subject/individual (this probably shouldn't be necessary given that all in-person human subject visits are on hold).
* Wipe down circumaural head phones with "audio-wipes" after each use (insert earphones tips are single use, of course). If you can't find audiowipes or if we run out, Kleenex with a dash of Purell is a good substitute.
* Discard all single-use items in the trash including syringes, used tape, eartips for insert earphones etc.
* Ensure that our facilities are locked when leaving.
